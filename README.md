# Address-Book-Using-Java-Sevlet-JSP-and-JDBC
Address Book Using Java, Sevlet, JSP and JDBC

This project is an Address Book web application developed using Java Servlets and JSP. The application allows users to manage their contacts by performing various operations such as adding a new contact, editing existing contacts, deleting contacts, and viewing all the contacts. The project was developed as part of my internship at Ainosoft, where I gained hands-on experience in the following technologies:

1. Java Servlets
2. JavaServer Pages (JSP)
3. Maven
4. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

## Project Overview

The Address Book web application is a dynamic Maven web project created using Eclipse IDE. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing contacts and leverages the power of Servlets and JSP to handle different operations on the data.

### Features

- Add a new contact with details like name, phone number, and email address.
- Edit existing contact information to update any changes.
- Delete unwanted contacts from the address book.
- View a list of all contacts stored in the address book.

## Technologies Used

1. **Java Servlets:** Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and responses. They provide the backbone of this web application, handling various CRUD operations on the address book.

2. **JavaServer Pages (JSP):** JSP allows for the dynamic generation of web content using Java code mixed with HTML. It enables us to create the user interface and display data from the Servlets.

3. **Maven:** Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects. It helps manage project dependencies and simplifies the build process.

4. **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):** JDBC is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases. It enables the application to connect to a database and execute queries.

## How to Use

To run the Address Book web application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 

2. Import the project into your Eclipse IDE as a Maven project.

3. Configure the database connection in the project to match your database credentials.

4. Deploy the application on a local servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

5. Access the web application by visiting http://localhost:<port>/address-book in your web browser.
